Problem Statement: Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

An increasing subsequence is a subsequence in which the elements are in increasing order, but not necessarily contiguous.

Example:

Input: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]

Output: 6 (The longest increasing subsequence is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80])

Constraints:

The input array may contain duplicates.
The length of the input array can be up to 10^3.
